As I thought then, and think now, this coming new year holds new experiences, new challenges, new friendships, new disappointments, new victories, and new heartaches. The fact of the matter is, life is unpredictable, and at times, downright tough!<br /><br />I've been through some very difficult situations, I've also been on the mountain top of good times, and I'm VERY THANKFUL TO GOD for it all!&nbsp; God, in Jesus Christ, is my source of balance, my reason to be able to cope with the bad times and find even more joy in the good times. My sense of stability, or balance in my life, is not dependent upon what I have, how much I own, where I live, what I drive, what influential people I know, how much I earn, how well I'm known, or ANY other matter that may make my life unstable or unbalanced!&nbsp; My sense of stability and balance in life is founded upon a rock; (Jesus) "You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God!"&nbsp; Jesus is my rock, my salvation, my stability, and balance in life.&nbsp; Do you know Him?<br /><br />Yep, 2015 has its own promise, AND its own dangers!&nbsp; Lord willing, and by His leading, I'll make it through another year. Shoot, I may even make it to 64 years old!&nbsp; LOL! &nbsp;<br /><br />Your servant in Christ,<br />&lt;&gt;&lt; Pastor Jay</font><br /><br /></div>

As we were  preparing to leave, Sophia became perturbed that we were not including  her in our plans and told us, "I don't want you to ever come back!"&nbsp;  While that stung a little, we realized she's four years old, used to  pretty much getting her way, and because of that didn't really mean what  she said. We left for our trip. <br /><br />When we  returned, Sophia's attitude miraculously changed!&nbsp; She ran to Gail and  gave her a big hug and kiss, then the same for me. As I was resting in  my easy chair a few minutes later, Sophia came into my "man cave" and  sat on the arm of my chair. She put her head on my shoulder and said, "I  love you PaPa, and really, really missed you!&nbsp; Please don't ever leave  me again. Do you promise me?"&nbsp; I said, "I promise!" but we all know  that's a promise I cannot keep. One day I will leave and never come  back. I didn't intentionally lie to Sophia, I just made a promise that's  impossible for me to keep. <br /><br />Jesus said, "I  will NEVER leave you or forsake you."&nbsp; What is impossible for me, is  possible for Jesus!&nbsp; He has been and will forever be there when we call  on His name!&nbsp; I've personally experienced that promise, and many more  that Jesus made. Thank you, Lord, for keeping all of your promises!<br /><br />&lt;&gt;&lt; Jay</strong></font><br /></div>

Unfortunately the price of these small transplants has sky rocketed and my garden budget limits what I can plant. I love egg plant. I only could manage to afford one plant. Yesterday I was admiring the gardens progress, especially the single egg plant and wishing that I had more than one.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    This morning there was an event at Barron Park for children to have free photo IDs made<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  In among the games, pony rides hot dog sales and the like was a small earth day booth that was giving away small transplants of greens, watermelons and, you guessed it egg plants.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    My garden now has 6 eggplants and all kinds of salad greens. God is so good, think about it: the generosity of the farmer who donated the flats of plants, the people who solicited the plants and set up and manned the booth, the initial decision to even do the booth. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  And with God in the mix I and many others were blessed.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Too often we think of things as a matter of good timing or good luck. Not so. Our God is a God of blessings. The One who hears and answers and is among us. Our part is to work together looking for any needs in the community. He is our assurance that the blessings will not only come, but be multiplied beyond our expectations.</font><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Rita Dunne</font><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  </div>

                <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#093dad" size="3"><font size="5">I would like to begin my testimony </font>i<font size="2">n March of 2007.&nbsp; That is when my life began to change, or should I say, turn around.&nbsp; I had always considered myself a Christian, although, for the most part, I only went to church Christmas and Easter.&nbsp; I was carrying a lot of anger and hurt from early on in my life due to feelings in my heart that my mother didn't love me. And, if she did, she didn't treat me as she did my siblings.&nbsp; This also caused me to be angry with God, as I figured He could have done something about it.&nbsp; My anger was so strong that when my mother passed away I didn't even go to her funeral.&nbsp; WOW!!&nbsp; I figured that was unforgivable.&nbsp; Anyway, in March of 2007 my son, Al, called me to say he would like to treat me to a 3 day Christian retreat.&nbsp; I immediately told him no.&nbsp; He said he thought it would help me and would be an opportunity to rid myself of some garbage I was carrying around.&nbsp; I said no.&nbsp; So we went back and forth this way until he got nasty.&nbsp; He finally said, "If you won't do it for yourself, will you do it for me?"&nbsp; Well, this was like saying to me, "If you love me, you'll do it."&nbsp; And I do love him, so i agreed to go but told him when it's over, it's over and we will not discuss it anymore.&nbsp; Well, I went on this retreat and on the last day I didn't feel any different than when I had arrived.&nbsp; That was until a Pastor who was there took hold of me and said, "God just told me you haven't let go of anything and you are still angry with Him."&nbsp; That was true, but I thought God and I were the only ones who knew that.&nbsp; Then, before I could walk away from the Pastor, he wrapped his arms around me and began praying.&nbsp; I don't know what he prayed or how long, but all of a sudden it wasn't the Pastor holding me.&nbsp; I was lifted up and felt like I was floating and all my anger and hurt was gone.&nbsp; My heart burst open and I forgave myself and others, I was crying and sobbing like a baby.&nbsp; Later, the Pastor told me he knew the instant it wasn't him holding me.&nbsp; This was my first encounter with my Savior.&nbsp; Little did I know at the time that it would not be my last, I said in the beginning that my life was turned around.&nbsp; Well, I haven't missed a Sunday going to church except when I was too sick to go.<br /></font></font><span><br /><span><font color="#093dad" size="2">Now, let me move forward to the end of 2012 when my life changed again.<br /></font><span><br /><span><font color="#093dad" size="2">I don't know exactly when, but toward the end of 2012 my health began to deteriorate.&nbsp; Mainly it began with my energy level going downhill little by little.&nbsp; The sad thing was I didn't pay attention to what was happening even though Carolyn (my wife) did.&nbsp; And then it happened!&nbsp; Around April 1st , 2013, I got a stomach virus and in 5 days of being sick I had lost 10 pounds. The health problems only got worse, although I was eating, though little at most, I continued to lose weight.&nbsp; Before the end of May I had lost 35 pounds.&nbsp; I had no energy and was sleeping 16 hours a day.&nbsp; I was seeing more doctors and specialists than you can imagine.&nbsp; I had x-rays, a full body scan, all sorts of blood workup from the hematologist including a bone marrow test and was told all seemed negative.&nbsp; My joints were going crazy also.&nbsp; I would wake up in the middle of the night with horrible pains in my hands or elbows or in my knees or wrists.&nbsp; I never knew where it was going to strike next.&nbsp; My overall health was so poor that I hadn't been out of the house except for doctors' appointments in weeks.&nbsp; To be truthful, at this point, I was ready for anything.&nbsp; In fact, Carolyn and I had begun having long talks about the end of life and I can honestly say I was ready and I wasn't afraid.&nbsp; It's just that this was happening so fast, we had never thought in terms of life and death situations before.&nbsp; But, at the same time, we both knew how serious everything was.&nbsp; Many tears and feelings were shared with each other and I think we both knew we were going to be okay with whatever the end result would be.&nbsp; Finally, early Monday morning, May 27th the hematologist called my lung doctor who in turn called us telling us to go to the emergency room ASAP.&nbsp; My platelets were way too high and my red and white blood cells were going crazy.&nbsp; When the doctors finally admitted me they didn't know what was wrong, and little by little, my whole body was shutting down........and it was happening fast.&nbsp; Gradually I was losing movement of my legs and body.&nbsp; My kidneys were failing, my right wrist was swollen and inflamed and so sore you couldn't touch it.&nbsp; Then on Tuesday afternoon they made a diagnosis.&nbsp; I have a rare disease of the small and midsize blood vessels which can affect the nose, the ears, the eyes. the lungs, the kidneys and the joints.&nbsp; When they took me for a kidney biopsy I couldn't even roll over by myself.&nbsp; That evening I was like a totally paralyzed person.&nbsp; I couldn't hold a spoon or fork and Carolyn had to feed me.&nbsp; Her worse fears seemed to be that when she returned Wednesday the doctors would tell her they were going to put me in hospice.&nbsp; Her last words to me were, "I don't want to lose you."<br /></font><span><br /><span><font color="#093dad" size="2">What happened next I have a hard time explaining or believing.&nbsp; But a peace came over me and I knew I wasn't alone.&nbsp; Have any of you ever felt the presence of Jesus?&nbsp; Well, I could feel His presence without actually seeing Him.&nbsp; Not only that but we were at the doorway to heaven and it was closed.&nbsp; I couldn't see what heaven looked like but I knew that was where Jesus and I were, and then Jesus let me know not to worry.&nbsp; Carolyn was going to be fine and so also was I.&nbsp; And then Jesus gave me the choice to go through the door with Him or I could stay behind, either way He would be with me and everything would be alright.&nbsp; The moment this happened a peace came over me that is beyond description.&nbsp; Nothing I know compares.&nbsp; It was like love, peace, joy, tranquility, understanding, warmth, comfort and more.&nbsp; And I gave Jesus all I am and have,&nbsp; I knew I had nothing to worry about by staying behind.&nbsp; This was in he middle of the night, I woke up and rang for the nurse and when she arrived I was without pain of any kind, my wrist was pain free, the swelling gone, no inflammation and I could move every part of my body.&nbsp; I have had no pain since.<br /></font><span><br /><span><font color="#093dad" size="2">When Carolyn came in Wednesday morning I was sitting up in the chair and had fed myself.&nbsp; I was so sure at first what had happened was a dream that Carolyn was the only one I told for several days.&nbsp; And every doctor treating me told me the same thing, "It wasn't us, you had help."&nbsp; I have to agree.&nbsp; The healing that took place in that short period of time, the peace that came over me and the choice I was given could have only come from Jesus.<br /></font><span><br /><span><font color="#093dad" size="2">The look on Carolyn's face when she saw me sitting up Wednesday morning was priceless.&nbsp; She asked me how come I didn't go through the door with Jesus.&nbsp; The only answer I have is, I know the peace and love that is waiting for me.&nbsp; I don't know what heaven looks like, I just know that Jesus is with me here and He will be waiting for me at the door when my time comes.&nbsp; And I'm good with that whether it's tomorrow or a year or more, and even though what I have is incurable, right now I am in remission, and I'm here to tell you that the same peace and love is waiting for everyone of you who has accepted Jesus as your Savior.&nbsp; A peace that is beyond your imagination awaits you.<br /></font><span><br /><span><font color="#093dad" size="2">The Disciple Paul says in Philippians 4:7, "The peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard our hearts and minds in Jesus Christ."<br /></font><span><br /><span><font color="#093dad" size="2">In Galatians 5:22-25 the Fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness and self-control and since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.<br /></font><span><br /><span><font color="#093dad" size="2">When I accepted this gift Jesus gave me, to tell you the truth I didn't expect more than a couple of weeks or maybe a month or two.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I appreciate every moment I have here and I certainly don't regret the decision I made.&nbsp; Do I worry about how much time I have?&nbsp; Absolutely NOT!&nbsp; The Lord told me I would be alright and I am.&nbsp; I am still pain free and comfortable with my life but when He calls me home I am ready and looking forward to walking through the door with Him and feeling that peace again.</font><br /></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>

This particular Sunday afternoon, as it came time for the Pastor and his son to go to the streets with their tracts, it was very cold outside as well as pouring down rain. The boy bundled up in his warmest and driest clothes and said---"OK dad, I'm ready."<br /> <br /> His Pastor dad asked---"Ready for what ?" "Dad, it's time we gather our tracts together and go out." Dad responds, "Son, it's very cold outside and it's pouring down rain." The boy gives his dad a surprised look, asking, "But Dad, aren't people still going to Hell, even though it's raining?"<br /> <br /> Dad answers, "Son, I am not going out in this weather." Despondently, the boy asks, "Dad, can I go? Please?" His father hesitated for a moment then said, "Son, you can go. Here's the tracts; be careful son." "Thanks Dad!!!" And with that, he was off and out into the rain. This eleven year old boy walked the streets of the town going door to door and handing everybody he met in the street a Gospel Tract. After two hours of walking in the rain, he was soaking, bone-chilled wet and down to his VERY LAST TRACT. He stopped on a corner and looked for someone to hand a tract to, but the streets were totally deserted.<br /> <br /> Then he turned toward the first home he saw and started up the sidewalk to the front door and rang the door bell. He rang the bell, but nobody answered. He rang it again and again, but still no one answered. He waited but still no answer. Finally, this eleven year old trooper turned to leave, but something stopped him. Again, he turned to the door and rang the bell and knocked loudly on the door with his fist. He waited, something holding him there on the front porch. He rang again, and this time the door slowly opened.<br /> <br /> Standing in the doorway was a very sad-looking elderly lady. She softly asked, " What can I do for you son?" With radiant eyes and a smile that lit up her world, this little boy said, "Ma'am, I'm sorry if I disturbed you, but I just want to tell you that JESUS REALLY DOES LOVE YOU, and I came to give you my very last Gospel Tract which will tell you all about JESUS and His great LOVE." With that, he handed her his last tract, and turned to leave.<br /> <br /> She called to him as he departed. "Thank you, son! And God Bless You!"<br /> <br /> Well, the following Sunday morning in church, Pastor Dad was in the pulpit. As the service began, he asked, "Does anybody have a testimony or want to say anything?" Slowly, in the back row of the church, an elderly lady stood to her feet.<br /> <br /> As she began to speak, a look of glorious radiance came from her face as she, "No one in this church knows me. I've never been here before. You see, before last Sunday I was not a Christian. My husband passed on some time ago, leaving me totally alone in this world.<br /> <br /> Last Sunday, being a particularly cold and rainy day, it was even more so in my heart that I came to the end of the line where I no longer had any hope or will to live. So I took a rope and a chair and ascended the stairway into the attic of my home. I fastened the rope securely to a rafter in the roof, then stood on the chair and fastened the other end of the rope around my neck.<br /> <br /> Standing on that chair, so lonely and brokenhearted, I was about to leap off, when suddenly the loud ringing of my doorbell downstairs startled me. I thought, "I'll wait a minute, and whoever it is will go away." I waited and waited, but the ringing doorbell seemed to get louder and more insistent, and then the person ringing also started knocking loudly. I thought to myself again, "Who on earth could this be?! Nobody ever rings my bell or comes to see me." I loosened the rope from my neck and started for the front door, all the while the bell rang louder and louder.<br /> <br /> When I opened the door and looked, I could hardly believe my eyes, for there on my front porch was the most radiant and angelic little boy I had ever seen in my life. His SMILE, oh, I could never describe it to you!! And the words that came from his mouth caused my heart, that had long been dead, TO LEAP TO LIFE, as he exclaimed with a cherub-like voice, <br /> <br /> "Ma'am, I just came to tell you that JESUS REALLY DOES LOVE YOU." Then he gave me this Gospel Tract that I now hold in my hand. As the little angel disappeared back out into the cold and rain, I closed my door and read slowly every word of this Gospel Tract. Then I went up to my attic to get my rope and chair. I wouldn't be needing them any more. You see, I am now a Happy Child of the KING, and since the address of your church was on the back of this Gospel Tract, I have come here to personally say THANK YOU TO GOD'S LITTLE ANGEL WHO CAME JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME AND, BY SO DOING, SPARED MY SOUL FROM ETERNITY IN HELL."<br /> <br /> There were now no dry eyes in the church. And as shouts of praise and honor to THE KING resounded off the very rafters of the building, Pastor Dad descended from the pulpit to the front pew where the little angel was seated. He took his son in his arms and sobbed uncontrollably. Probably no church has had a more glorious moment, AND probably this universe has never seen a Dad that was more filled with love &amp; honor for his son EXCEPT for ONE. This FATHER also allowed His Son to go out into a cold and dark world. He received His Son back with joy unspeakable, and as all of heaven shouted praises and honor to THE KING, The FATHER sat HIS BELOVED SON on a throne far above all principality and power and every name that is named.<br /> <br /> There may be SOMEONE reading this who is also going through a dark, cold, lonely time in his or her soul. You may even be a Christian, for we are not without problems, OR you may not yet know THE KING. Whatever the case and whatever the problem or situation you find yourself in, and no matter how DARK it may seem, I want you to know that I just came to tell you that JESUS REALLY DOES LOVE YOU.<br /> <br /> ~ May the Love and Grace and Mercy<br /> of the Lord Jesus Christ be yours Tonight !<br /> <br /> * God bless and keep sharing the Good News !!! ~ C4C<br /><span style=""></span></font><br /><span style=""></span>  </div>

I had planned the garden, bought  the seed, prepared the soil and was quite in charge of the whole  project. Turning over the soil I came upon two &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; bean plants.  (For you non garden folks a &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; is a plant you don&rsquo;t plant, it  just comes up from last years seed having lain dormant over the winter.)  It started me thinking.&nbsp; Am I really essential here? They grew very  well without any effort on my part.<br /><br />     What is essential is life itself. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how we arrived  at where we are now.&nbsp; How we grew, whether we were cherished or not,  what we possess, what talents we have. Life is the precious thing. &nbsp;My  life and yours are gifts from God.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t mindlessly create us to  fend for ourselves. He didn&rsquo;t carelessly create us for no purpose; on  some sort of whim. You and I were created by Him, for Him and to be with  Him. When we forget that, when we worry, get weary, judge ourselves to  be failures, when we see no meaning for our lives, then recall the words  of the prophet Isaiah:<br /><br />    Isaiah 60:1 &ldquo;Arise, shine, for thy light is come; and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee."&nbsp; <br /><br />   This is a command to us, accompanied by the strength of God to do it.  It is a call to remember who you are. Created and cherished, loved  simply for the creature you are.<br /><br />  Our purpose is to be a light in a very dark world.<br /><br />    Rita Dunne</font></div>

                                        I have known and loved this 28th verse from
                                        Matthew for many years. God actually used this particular portion of His Word to draw me to Him
                                        in a complete surrender and yielding of my life. I was exhausted from laboring to be
                                        what I and (I felt) others expected me to be and knowing that I just never seemed to
                                        measure up to these expectations. I needed not only His rest, but His
                                        forgiveness.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>

                                        There was much more that Jesus wanted to teach me from this
                                        verse and the two following, for I would strive to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; others and difficult
                                        situations even as I prayed&nbsp;

                                        for His help. Through the years of many lessons, I am
                                        learning that these three verses mean exactly what they say. As I assume His yoke and learn
                                        of Him, I do experience an unexplainable peace and rest. As I trust more and more in
                                        Him and His promises in all situations (and some can be extremely stressful), I
                                        know that He means when He says ---- He will walk continuously with me, no matter
                                        what. He will give wisdom and guidance as I ask, and somehow all things do work
                                        together for good.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;"><font color="#036637"><strong style="">Most of the time life is good. The rest of the time life it is great!</strong><br /><br />The  other afternoon Sophia asked me to go outside with her. I asked her  what we were going to do and she said that we wouldn't know until we got  outside. In other words, she was clueless.&nbsp; Well, I watched her ride  her bike for awhile, then we played with her hula hoop. And yes, the  funniest thing you will EVER see is me trying to hula hoop, but I  digress. Sophia brought the hula hoop back into the garage and came back  to me with two big pieces of sidewalk chalk-one pink, one yellow. She  said, "Papa, draw me."&nbsp; She laid down on the driveway and I traced  around her little body. She got up and finished her outline by adding  arms, hands, legs, feet, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and hair. We stood  back and admired her artwork. But then she said, "OK Papa, it's your  turn. Lay down and let me draw you."&nbsp; Reluctantly I laid down and Sophia  traced around me, well, kinda. I arose and she finished my manatee  looking outline, drawing arms, hands, legs, feet, etc, etc.&nbsp; My  caricature in chalk was finished and we stood there together marveling  over this street artwork. Then Sophia said, "Look Papa, we're holding  hands. Me and Papa are friends!&nbsp; I love you, Papa."&nbsp; I immediately  thought of the words to a song we sing in church; "I Am A Friend Of God,  He Calls Me Friend." I realized at that very moment that the joy that  floods my entire being by Sophia calling me her friend, is the exact joy  that overwhelms me when I hear, "He calls me friend."<br /><br /><strong style="">Most of the time life is good, the rest of the time life is great!<br /><br />In Christ it's all great!<br />&lt;&gt;&lt; Jay</strong></font></div>

That&rsquo;s an easy statement to make until you are in the middle of the fight of your life.&nbsp; Only when you are on the other side can you look back and see how God orchestrated your way for you through the curves and potholes, the detours and lane changes in the road of life.&nbsp; Then you can truly know that you have faith &ndash; a faith that has served you well.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t feel afraid of the future because when you look back over your journey and see all that God has done for you, faith will burst forth in your spirit and you can confidently say, He&rsquo;s not brought me this far to fail me now. I fell in love with Jesus as a young girl and felt his closeness even in school during all the years of teen age drama.&nbsp; It was easy because my life was pretty smooth.&nbsp; When my marriage dissolved after 30+ years I didn&rsquo;t feel his closeness at all.&nbsp; I felt very alone, hurt and scared. Like the video we watched a few weeks ago, I said on many occasions, &ldquo;God where are you in this mess&rdquo;?&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t hear anything because I don&rsquo;t think I listened, I wanted my way and I wanted it then. I remember telling God IF you can bring some sanity into my life (and I did say if) I promise to try and help others who will walk this path.&nbsp; He did bring sanity, He did send people into my path to minister to, and as He promises in his word, He did exceedingly more than I knew how to imagine or ask for. During the next twenty years I learned a lot.&nbsp; I learned that my Heavenly Father needed to be the focus of my life, that I needed time alone with Him so we could build a friendship. It wasn&rsquo;t easy and it didn&rsquo;t come over night. &nbsp;I found a book with the names of God along with their meanings and learned that he was my savior, redeemer, provider, my comforter, my healer and that he did indeed love me unconditionally.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    &nbsp; I learned, with his help, that I could step out of my comfort zone and eventually that zone became much larger than it started out to be.&nbsp; Today I am married to the love of my life, but as Pastor Jay has said before; many times God wants to give us gifts, but the time is not right.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not saying no, he&rsquo;s saying not yet.&nbsp; Bill came into my life 20 years after my marriage ended.&nbsp; God needed to work out a lot in my life and at that time Bill was happily married.&nbsp; When the time was right, and only when the time was right, we both acknowledge God orchestrated our friendship and love. I am always willing to share my testimony in the hopes it will encourage everyone who knows me to believe that God is working in their lives no matter what the situation is. Whether it&rsquo;s a failed marriage, the loss of a loved one, disappointment, loneliness &ndash; in all things God knows and is working.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    &nbsp;Hebrews 11:1 is referred to as the faith chapter &ndash; it says Now faith is the confident assurance that what we hope for is going to happen.&nbsp; It is the evidence of things we cannot yet see.&nbsp; Believe this and you can not only make it through the hard times, but you can and will come out victorious on the other side. I am signing my name not to draw attention to me, (on my own I have nothing to offer)&nbsp; but because of my promise to God, I&rsquo;m still available to listen, to care and to pray.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    Vicki Burke</font><br /><span style=""></span>  </div>
